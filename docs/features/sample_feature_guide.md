# UsampleUfeature Feature Guide

This document provides an overview of the `sample_feature` feature.

## Overview

The UsampleUfeature feature provides functionality to manage and display LUsampleUfeature data.

## Architecture

The feature follows Clean Architecture principles with the following layers:

- **Data Layer**: Handles data sources, models, and repository implementations
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, repository interfaces, and use cases
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface components and state management

## Components

### Data Layer

- `sample_feature_model.dart`: Data model representing a LUsampleUfeature
- `sample_feature_remote_datasource.dart`: Handles API calls for LUsampleUfeature data
- `sample_feature_local_datasource.dart`: Handles local storage for LUsampleUfeature data
- `sample_feature_repository_impl.dart`: Implements the repository interface

### Domain Layer

- `sample_feature_entity.dart`: Core business entity
- `sample_feature_repository.dart`: Repository interface defining data operations
- `get_all_sample_features.dart`: Use case to retrieve all LUsampleUfeatures
- `get_sample_feature_by_id.dart`: Use case to retrieve a specific LUsampleUfeature

### Presentation Layer

- `sample_feature_list_screen.dart`: Screen to display a list of LUsampleUfeatures
- `sample_feature_detail_screen.dart`: Screen to display details of a specific LUsampleUfeature
- `sample_feature_list_item.dart`: Widget to display a single LUsampleUfeature in a list

### Providers

- `sample_feature_providers.dart`: Riverpod providers for the feature
- `sample_feature_ui_providers.dart`: UI-specific state providers

## Usage

### Adding a UsampleUfeature

1. Navigate to the UsampleUfeature List Screen
2. Tap the + button
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Submit the form

### Viewing UsampleUfeature Details

1. Navigate to the UsampleUfeature List Screen
2. Tap on a UsampleUfeature item to view its details

## Implementation Notes

- The feature uses Riverpod for state management
- Error handling follows the Either pattern from dartz
- Repository pattern is used to abstract data sources
